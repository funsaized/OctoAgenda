Implement optimizations for the complete system:

1. Cost optimization:
   - Cache AI extractions (Redis/KV store)
   - Batch API calls efficiently
   - Use regex pre-filtering to reduce AI usage
   - Implement smart chunking to minimize tokens

2. Performance optimization:
   - Parallel processing where possible
   - Stream processing for large datasets
   - Lazy loading of dependencies
   - Edge caching for static resources

3. Reliability improvements:
   - Circuit breaker pattern for external services
   - Graceful degradation strategies
   - Queue system for retries
   - Idempotency keys for operations

4. Monitoring and alerting:
   - APM integration (Datadog/New Relic)
   - Custom metrics dashboard
   - Cost tracking and budgets
   - Anomaly detection

5. Documentation:
   - API documentation with examples
   - Deployment guide
   - Troubleshooting runbook
   - Performance tuning guide

Include benchmarks showing before/after improvements.
