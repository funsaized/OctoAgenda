Create a complete test suite using Jest and Testing Library:

1. Unit tests for each module:
   - HTML fetching with mocked responses
   - AI extraction with fixture data
   - Timezone conversions (edge cases)
   - ICS generation validation

2. Integration tests:
   - End-to-end pipeline with mock API
   - Calendar service integration
   - Error recovery scenarios

3. Test fixtures:
   - Sample HTML pages (various formats)
   - Known event patterns
   - Edge cases (malformed dates, missing data)

4. Performance tests:
   - Measure API call efficiency
   - Token usage optimization
   - Processing time benchmarks

5. Validation tests:
   - ICS RFC compliance
   - Timezone accuracy
   - Character encoding

Include:
- Coverage reports (aim for >80%)
- Continuous integration setup
- Mock data generators

Theory: Comprehensive testing reduces production incidents by 60%
